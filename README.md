**Notice**: DeepForge is still a work in progress and is also lacking significant documentation! That being said, any contributions and/or feedback is greatly appreciated (and feel free to always ask any questions on the gitter)!

# DeepForge
DeepForge is an open-source visual development environment for deep learning. Currently, it supports Convolutional Neural Networks but we are planning on supporting additional deep learning classifiers such as RNNs and LSTMs. Additional features include real-time collaborative editing and version control.

## Quick Start
Simply run the following command to install deepforge with its dependencies:

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dfst/deepforge/master/install.sh | bash
```

Or, if you already have NodeJS (v6) installed, simply run

```
npm install -g deepforge
```

Next, start deepforge with `deepforge start`!

Finally, navigate to [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888) to start using DeepForge! For more, detailed instructions, check out the [wiki](https://github.com/dfst/deepforge/wiki/Installation-Guide).

Also, be sure to check out the other available features of the `deepforge` cli; it can be used to update, manage your torch installation, uninstall deepforge and run individual components!
